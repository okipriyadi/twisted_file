"""
Point-to-point connections handle a lot of communication needs, but passing the same
information between many peers becomes challenging as the number of direct connec-
tions grows. Sending messages separately to each recipient consumes additional pro-
cessing time and bandwidth, which can be a problem for applications such as streaming
video or audio. Using multicast to deliver messages to more than one endpoint at a time
achieves better efficiency because the network infrastructure ensures that the packets
are delivered to all recipients

Multicast messages are always sent using UDP, since TCP requires an end-to-end
communication channel. The addresses for multicast, called multicast groups, are a sub-
set of the regular IPv4 address range (224.0.0.0 through 230.255.255.255) reserved for
multicast traffic. These addresses are treated specially by network routers and switches,
so messages sent to the group can be distributed over the Internet to all recipients that
have joined the group.

Note: Some managed switches and routers have multicast traffic disabled by
default. If you have trouble with the example programs, check your network hard-
ware settings

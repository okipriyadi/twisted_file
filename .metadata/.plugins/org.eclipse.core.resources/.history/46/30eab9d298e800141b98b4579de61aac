"""
Sockets can be configured to act as a server and listen for incoming messages, or con-
nect to other applications as a client. After both ends of a TCP/IP socket are connected,
communication is bidirectional.
Echo Server
This sample program, based on the one in the standard library documentation, receives
incoming messages and echos them back to the sender. It starts by creating a TCP/IP
socket.
Then bind() is used to associate the socket with the server address. In this case,
the address is localhost , referring to the current server, and the port number is 10000.

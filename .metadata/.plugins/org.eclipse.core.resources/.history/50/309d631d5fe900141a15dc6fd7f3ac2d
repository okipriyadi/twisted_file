"""
Many servers have more than one network interface, and therefore, more than
one IP address. Rather than running separate copies of a service bound to each IP
address, use the special address INADDR_ANY to listen on all addresses at the same time.
Although socket defines a constant for INADDR_ANY , it is an integer value and must
be converted to a dotted-notation string address before it can be passed to bind() . As
a shortcut, use “ 0.0.0.0 ” or an empty string ( ” ) instead of doing the conversion.

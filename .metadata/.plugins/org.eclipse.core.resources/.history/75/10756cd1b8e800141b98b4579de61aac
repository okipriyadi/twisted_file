#The first step to establishing a multicast receiver is to create the UDP socket.
"""
    After the regular socket is created and bound to a port, it can be added to the
multicast group by using setsockopt() to change the IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP option.
The option value is the 8-byte packed representation of the multicast group address
followed by the network interface on which the server should listen for the traffic,
identified by its IP address. In this case, the receiver listens on all interfaces using
INADDR_ANY .

Point-to-point connections handle a lot of communication needs, but passing the same
information between many peers becomes challenging as the number of direct connec-
tions grows. Sending messages separately to each recipient consumes additional pro-
cessing time and bandwidth, which can be a problem for applications such as streaming
video or audio. Using multicast to deliver messages to more than one endpoint at a time
achieves better efficiency because the network infrastructure ensures that the packets
are delivered to all recipients

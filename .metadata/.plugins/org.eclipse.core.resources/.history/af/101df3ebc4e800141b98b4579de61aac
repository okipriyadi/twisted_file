"""
A transport represents the connection between two endpoints communicating over a
network. Transports describe connection details: for example, is this connection stream-
oriented (like TCP) or datagram-oriented (like UDP)? TCP, UDP, Unix sockets, and
serial ports are examples of transports. Transports implement the ITransport interface,
which has the following methods:
- write
  Write data to the physical connection in a nonblocking manner.
- writeSequence
  Write a list of strings to the physical connection. Useful when working with line oriented protocols.
- loseConnection
  Write all pending data and then close the connection.
- getPeer
  Get the remote address of the connection.
- getHost
Like getPeer , but returns the address of the local side of the connection.


methods:

- makeConnection
  Create a connection between two endpoints across a transport.
- connectionMade
  Called when a connection to another endpoint is made.
- dataReceived
  Called when data is received across a transport.
- connectionLost
  Called when the connection is shut down.

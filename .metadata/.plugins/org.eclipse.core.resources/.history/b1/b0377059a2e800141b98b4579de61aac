"""
From the programmer’s perspective, there are two essential differences between using
a UNIX domain socket and an TCP/IP socket. First, the address of the socket is a path
on the file system, rather than a tuple containing the server name and port. Second,
the node created in the file system to represent the socket persists after the socket
is closed and needs to be removed each time the server starts up. The echo server
example from earlier can be updated to use UDS by making a few changes in the setup
section.

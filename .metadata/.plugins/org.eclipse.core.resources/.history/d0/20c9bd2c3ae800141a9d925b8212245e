"""
Sockets have two primary properties controlling the way they send data: 
1. the address family => controls the OSI network layer protocol used, 
2. the socket type => controls the transport layer protocol

Python supports three address families. 
1. AF_INET , is used for IPv4 Internet addressing.
2. AF_INET6 is used for IPv6 Internet addressing.
3. AF_UNIX is the address family for UNIX Domain Sockets (UDS)

The socket type is usually either :
1. SOCK_DGRAM for user datagram protocol (UDP)
2. SOCK_STREAM for transmission control protocol (TCP)
3. SOCK_RAW
4. SOCK_RDM
5. SOCK_SECPAKET

- Socket addresses are represented as follows: A single string is used for the AF_UNIX address family.
- A pair (host, port) is used for the AF_INET address family
    where host is a string representing either a hostname in Internet domain notation like 'daring.cwi.nl' 
    or an IPv4 address like '100.50.200.5', and port is an integer
- For AF_INET6 address family, a four-tuple (host, port, flowinfo, scopeid) is used, where flowinfo and 
    scopeid represents sin6_flowinfo and sin6_scope_id member in struct sockaddr_in6 in C

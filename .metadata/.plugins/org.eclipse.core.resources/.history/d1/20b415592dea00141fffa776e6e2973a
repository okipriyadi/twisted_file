"""
The SocketServer module is a framework for creating network servers. It defines
classes for handling synchronous network requests (the server request-handler blocks
until the request is completed) over TCP, UDP, UNIX streams, and UNIX datagrams.
It also provides mix-in classes for easily converting servers to use a separate thread or
process for each request.

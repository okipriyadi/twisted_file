Purpose : Wait for notification that an input or output channel is ready.

Using select()
Python’s select() function is a direct interface to the underlying operating system
implementation. It monitors sockets, open files, and pipes (anything with a fileno()
method that returns a valid file descriptor) until they become readable or writable or
a communication error occurs. select() makes it easier to monitor multiple connec-
tions at the same time, and it is more efficient than writing a polling loop in Python using
socket timeouts, because the monitoring happens in the operating system network layer,
instead of the interpreter.

Note: Using Python’s file objects with select() works for UNIX, but is not
supported under Windows.

"""
The echo server example from the socket section can be extended to watch for
more than one connection at a time by using select() . The new version starts out by
creating a nonblocking TCP/IP socket and configuring it to listen on an address.
"""

import select
import socket
import sys
import Queue

# Create a TCP/IP socket
server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server.setblocking(0)
# Bind the socket to the port
server_address = (’localhost’, 10000)
print >>sys.stderr, ’starting up on %s port %s’ % server_address
server.bind(server_address)
# Listen for incoming connections
server.listen(5)

"""
The arguments to select() are three lists containing communication channels to
monitor. The first is a list of the objects to be checked for incoming data to be read,
the second contains objects that will receive outgoing data when there is room in their
buffer, and the third includes those that may have an error (usually a combination of
the input and output channel objects). The next step in the server is to set up the lists
containing input sources and output destinations to be passed to select() .
"""

# Sockets from which we expect to read
inputs = [ server ]

# Sockets to which we expect to write
outputs = [ ]

"""
Connections are added to and removed from these lists by the server main loop.
Since this version of the server is going to wait for a socket to become writable before
sending any data (instead of immediately sending the reply), each output connection
needs a queue to act as a buffer for the data to be sent through it.
"""

# Outgoing message queues (socket:Queue)
message_queues = {}
The main portion of the server program loops, calling select() to block and wait
for network activity.
while inputs:
# Wait for at least one of the sockets to be ready for processing
print >>sys.stderr, ’waiting for the next event’

outputs,
inputs)

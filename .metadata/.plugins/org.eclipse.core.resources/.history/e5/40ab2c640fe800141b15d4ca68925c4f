"""
Sockets have two primary properties controlling the way they send data: 
1. the address family => controls the OSI network layer protocol used, 
2. the socket type => controls the transport layer protocol

Python supports three address families. 
1. AF_INET , is used for IPv4 Internet addressing.
2. AF_INET6 is used for IPv6 Internet addressing.
3. AF_UNIX is the address family for UNIX Domain Sockets (UDS)

The socket type is usually either :
1. SOCK_DGRAM for user datagram protocol (UDP)
2. SOCK_STREAM for transmission control protocol (TCP)

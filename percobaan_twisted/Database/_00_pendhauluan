"""
Because Twisted applications run in an event loop, the application must not make
blocking calls in the main thread or the entire event loop will stall. Because most data‐
bases expose a blocking API, Twisted provides twisted.enterprise.adbapi as a non-
blocking interface to the DB-API 2.0 API implemented by Python bindings for most
popular databases, including MySQL, Postgres, and SQLite.
Nonblocking Database Queries
Switching from the blocking API to adbapi is a straightforward transforma‐
tion: instead of creating individual database connections, use a connection from
adbapi.ConnectionPool , which manages a pool of connections run in separate threads
for you. Once you have a database cursor, instead of using the blocking execute and
fetchall methods, use dbpool.runQuery to execute a SQL query and return the result.
Example 8-1 demonstrates executing a nonblocking SELECT query on a hypothetical
SQLite database called users.db (the errback has been omitted for brevity).
